Problem Formulation
let define the main problam 1 step completed The main problem you are working on is: modeling and understanding the relationship between Age and Blood Pressure using simple linear regression, and comparing implementations.​

Problem in words You have a small data set of pairs ( Age , Blood Pressure ) (Age,Blood Pressure).
You want to:

Fit a regression line (best fit line) to this data.

Use the line to predict blood pressure for given ages.

Interpret the slope and intercept (in English and Arabic).

Compare doing this with NumPy vs scikit‑learn in terms of code and speed
